_Biomodels Curation_ The model reproduces the flux value of "Gpp p" (rate of
Glycerol synthesis) as depicted in Fig 3 of the paper. The model reproduces
the flux for early exponential phase , however it can be used to reproduce the
values for other phases by plugging in appropriate values for maximal rates as
given in Table 1 and metabolite concentrations as given in Table 2 of the
paper. The model was succesfully reproduced using Jarnac.
